# Pentest Distro Builder

This script automates the process of building the most common pentesting Linux distributions, Kali Linux and Parrot Security OS.

## Running

Just clone the repository, then make whatever changes you wish to make.
* .deb files in the debs/ folder will be installed into the image.
* Files in the filesystem/ folder will be copied to the system.
* Add any extra software from the repository you wish to install to the config/software.list.chroot file.

When you're ready to build, run `sudo ./runme.sh` .  Once it's complete, the finished image will be copied to the images/ folder.

If you run the script without any options, it will build whichever OS you are currently running, and prompt for which desktop environment and repository you wish to use.  If you wish, however, you can manually specify these options instead:

* -u 
  * Unattended mode (skip the menu, required for the other options to function)
* -l 
  * Linux distribution you wish to build (can be either "Kali" or "Parrot")
* -d
  * Desktop environment (can be one of "cinnamon", "gnome", "kde", "lxde", "mate", or "xfce")
* -r (optional)
  * Repository  (can be either "default" for the distribution's default repo, or an IP address)

## Examples
`sudo ./runme.sh -u -l Kali -d mate -r 192.168.0.30`
This will build a Kali Linux .iso, with the MATE desktop environment, using a local repository at 192.168.0.30

`sudo ./runme.sh -u -l Parrot -d cinnamon`
This will build a Parrot Security OS .iso, with the Cinnamon desktop environment, using the default Parrot repository.  If -r is unspecified, then the default will be used.
